Assignment Summary:

We must write a C++ program that simulates a 2 player, Basketball shooting game. 
There are 5 racks with 5 balls. The first 4 balls are worth 1 point each, and the 5th ball (“money ball”) is worth 2 points. 
There are additionally 2 other shot locations between racks 2-3 and 3-4 called “Starry Range” that has a “Starry ball” worth 3 points. 
Prior to each players simulation, the player can choose one of the ball racks (1-5) to be filled with only “money balls” called the “money-ball rack”. 
Goal is to have the most points after both players have “shot” every ball. 
Once simulation is completed a winner is decided and then there will be a prompt asking to play again or quit (end program).
